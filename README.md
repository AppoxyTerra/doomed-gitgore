# doomed-gitgore
A little program to run in the background to auto-commit-push-pull and force obliterate merge conflicts. That's radioactive stuff !  
It should be compatible with Windows, macOS and Linux, as long as `gitgore.py` is in the project's directory, and `git` commands are enabled in this directory.
